# What is SoftStack Factory?

{:.left}
With the high-skilled labor shortage in America, a big number of US companies 
turned to offshore workers as an option. SSF is a non-profit company with the 
goal to bring back these jobs and re-shore North America with local high-skilled 
workers. SoftStack Factory (SSF) is a concept of an intensive software training
school, combined with an On the Job Training, to a full time opportunity. SSF 
will select candidates from a pool of Community College bound population, via 
a regime of discovery and selection process. The concept uses open source, free or almost free tools to create software in a factory manner.
